Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome. In order to contribute first fork the repository and create a pull
request. For large changes or those that have design impact it is best to create an issue and
propose the change first.

When submitting a PR the request will be automatically built and tested in a CI environment.
However the CI tests do not test all functionality and additional checks maybe required
depending on the change before it can be merged. Additional tests should be provided for any new
functionality.

Follow the existing code style whenever possible. The code style is standard Java, 4 space indent
with line wrapping at 100 columns.

All contributors must accept the contribution agreement before any changes can be merged.
